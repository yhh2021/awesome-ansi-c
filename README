Probability is one of the most important features of C, while
compiler-specific extensions, like the GCC extensions, break this
pleasure. This list collects products written in ANSI C, or is easy to
be edited into ANSI C, as well as related tools.

sqlite

- Alternative to self-handled file storage with fopen, as well as JSON,
XML, etc. Create, edit, query, update, remove etc. for tabular data.
Free from handling the troublesome text encodings, endians, text quotes,
compressing etc..

- Cross-platform data: no madness for using files between big-endian and
little-endian architectures.

- ANSI C claim: https://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html .

- Faster than the filesystem by 35%:

- dash (?)
- GNU make (?)
- dbx (?)
        Alternative to gdb.
